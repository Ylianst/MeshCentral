# Plugins - Installation & Usage

!!!note
     Plugins as such receive **no support** by the main developers of MeshCentral. If you experience problems with MeshCentral please make sure to **disable all plugins before further troubleshooting**!

## Use Cases

Certain feature requests may not be suitable for all MeshCentral users and thus are available as a plugin. Furthermore users can develop their own plugins - as described further below - to extend functionality or benefit from integrating MeshCentral into their existing application environment.

## List of publically available plugins

<https://github.com/topics/meshcentral-plugin>

## Installation of a plugin

1. First please make sure that you enable plugins in the configuration
   >"plugins": {
   >    "enabled": true
   >},
2. Restart MeshCentral if you needed to change the configuration.
2. Log into MeshCentral as full administrator.
3. Go my `My Server` -> `Plugins`, then hit the Download plugin button.
4. A dialog opens requesting a URL, e.g. put in: <https://github.com/ryanblenis/MeshCentral-ScriptTask>
5. The plugin pops up in the plugin list below the download button, you can now configure and enable/disable it.

# Plugins - Development & Hooks

!!!note
     Plugins as such receive **no support** by the main developers of MeshCentral. If you experience problems with MeshCentral please make sure to **disable all plugins before further troubleshooting**!

## Overview

Not all feature requests may be suitable for all MeshCentral users and thus can't be integrated into MeshCentral directly. Hwoever, Instead of maintaining a complete fork of MeshCentral it is much easier to extend MeshCentral's functionality using hooks and writing plugins for it.

## Anatomy of a plugin:

    - plugin_name/
    -- config.json
    -- plugin_name.js
    -- modules_meshcore/ // optional
    --- plugin_name.js 	// optional

## Plugin Configuration File

A valid JSON object within a file named `config.json` in the root folder of your project. An example:

    {
      "name": "Plugin Name",
      "shortName": "plugin_name",
      "version": "0.0.0",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "description": "Short Description of the plugin",
      "hasAdminPanel": false,
      "homepage": "https://www.example.com",
      "changelogUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/User/Project/master/changelog.md",
      "configUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/User/Project/master/config.json",
      "downloadUrl": "https://github.com/User/Project/archive/master.zip",
      "repository": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/User/Project.git"
      },
      "versionHistoryUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/User/Project/tags",
      "meshCentralCompat": ">0.4.3"
    }

## Plugin Hooks

In essence, hooks are locations in the code which enable developers to tap into a module to either provide alternative behavior or to respond to an event.

These are separated into the following categories depending on the type of functionality the plugin should offer.

- Web UI, to modify the MeshCentral admin interface
- Back End, to modify core functionality of the server and communicate with the Web UI layer as well as the Mesh Agent (Node) layer to send commands and data
- Mesh Agent (Node), to introduce functionality to each agent

### Web UI Hooks

- `onDeviceRefreshEnd`: called when a device is selected in the MeshCentral web interface
- `registerPluginTab`: callable when a device is selected in the MeshCentral web interface to register a new tab for plugin data, if required. Accepts an object, or function that returns an object, with the following properties: { tabId: "yourShortNameHere", tabTitle: "Your Display Name"}. A tab and div with the associated ID and title will be created for your use
- `onDesktopDisconnect`: called when a remote desktop session is disconnected
- `onWebUIStartupEnd`: called when the page has loaded for the first time after a login / refresh
- `goPageStart`: called before page changes take effect. Passes 2 arguments (<page number> : int, <event> : Event)
- `goPageEnd`: called after page changes take effect. Passes 2 arguments (<page number> : int, <event> : Event)

#### Exports

Any function can be exported to the Web UI layer by adding the name of the function to an `exports` array in the plugin object.

### Back End Hooks

- `server_startup`: called once when the server starts (or when the plugin is first installed)
- `hook_agentCoreIsStable`: called once when an agent initially checks in
- `hook_processAgentData`: called each time an agent transmits data back to the server
- `hook_userLoggedIn`: called when a user has logged into the web interface
- `hook_setupHttpHandlers`: called before all http handlers are setup

### Mesh Agent

Use of the optional file `plugin_name.js` in the optional folder `modules_meshcore` will include the file in the default meshcore file sent to each endpoint. This is useful to add functionality on each of the endpoints.

## Structure

Much of MeshCentral revolves around returning objects for your structures, and plugins are no different. Within your plugin you can traverse all the way up to the web server and MeshCentral Server classes to access all the functionality those layers provide. This is done by passing the current object to newly created objects, and assigning that reference to a `parent` variable within that object.


## Ping-Pong

If you build a plugin which makes use of `meshrelay.ashx`, keep in mind to either handle ping-pong messages (`serverPing`, `serverPong`) on the control channel or to request MeshCentral to not send such messages through sending the `noping=1` parameter in the connection URL. For a deeper sight search for "PING/PONG" in `meshrelay.js`.

## Versioning

Versioning your plugin correctly and consistently is essential to ensure users of your plugin are prompted to upgrade when it is available. Semantic versioning is recommended.

## Changelog

A changelog is highly recommended so that your users know what's changed since their last version.

## Sample Plugin

[MeshCentral-Sample](https://github.com/ryanblenis/MeshCentral-Sample) is a simple plugin that, upon disconnecting from remote desktop, prompts the user to enter a manual event (note), pre-filled in with the date and timestamp.
