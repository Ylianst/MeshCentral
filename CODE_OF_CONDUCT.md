# MeshCentral Community Standards

## Purpose
The MeshCentral Community is composed of professionals and volunteers from around the world, working on development, support, mentorship, and community engagement. Our strength lies in our diversity, and our goal is to create a collaborative, welcoming, and technically focused environment. This code of conduct applies to all MeshCentral-managed spaces, including GitHub, Discord, Telegram, Reddit, forums, and any other community communication channels. Moderators and all community members are subject to these standards.

We should focus on welcoming anyone who wants to contribute, fostering engagement, and supporting community-driven improvements. Treat this code as a guide to make the community productive, inclusive, and enriching for everyone.

## Be Friendly and Welcoming
- Strive to make everyone feel included, supported, and valued.
- Be patient and understanding, particularly when communicating with members for whom English may not be their first language.
- Foster mentorship, guidance, and constructive collaboration whenever possible.

## Conduct
- Critique ideas, not individuals.
- Defamatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech is prohibited.
- Avoid personal attacks, harassment, or hostile behavior.
- Keep discussions constructive, respectful, and technically oriented.
- Choose words carefully and communicate professionally.
- Repeated harassment or ignoring a request to stop is unacceptable.

## Collaboration
- Welcome contributors of all experience levels.
- Prioritize community benefit over personal preferences or private agendas.
- Maintain openness to alternative solutions and approaches.
- Focus on engagement, community-driven improvements, and supporting contributors who want to participate actively.
- Resolve disagreements constructively, seeking to understand differing viewpoints. Mistakes happen; focus on learning and improving rather than assigning blame.

## Technical Rigor
- Share information that is accurate, verifiable, or based on direct experience.
- State clearly when uncertain or speculating.
- Encourage constructive correction and peer review without hostility.
- Consider the consequences of your work on other community members and users.

## Privacy and Security
- Do not share credentials, private data, or screenshots/logs containing sensitive information.
- Do not request or provide assistance with unauthorized access, illegal activity, or unsafe configurations.

## Contribution Etiquette
- When opening issues, provide clear context, reproducible steps, and relevant environment details.
- When proposing enhancements, remain receptive to critique and alternatives.
- Respect project maintainers, scope boundaries, and development priorities.
- Strive to provide helpful and actionable feedback to others in a constructive manner.

## How to Ask for Help Effectively
To receive accurate and useful support:
1. State your objective clearly.
2. Provide environment details (OS, MeshCentral version, hosting setup, network context).
3. Include reproducible steps and error messages (with sensitive data removed).
4. Describe what has already been attempted.
5. Ask specific, focused questions.
6. Keep your message structured and concise.

## Moderation
- Moderators across all community platforms are subject to this code.
- Moderators may remove content that violates these standards.
- Repeated violations may result in warnings, restricted participation, or removal from community spaces.
- Moderation actions must be applied consistently and impartially to maintain order and a positive environment.
- Moderators are encouraged to model friendliness, patience, and inclusivity.

## Language
- Use clear and comprehensible English.
- Maintain a professional, kind, and respectful tone at all times.

## Enforcement
Violations of these standards may result in warnings, content removal, or removal from community spaces. Severe or repeated violations may result in permanent exclusion. Members are encouraged to report any violations to moderators or directly to project maintainers.
