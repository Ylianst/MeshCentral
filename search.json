After over 8 years of working on the first version of MeshCentral, work as moved to version 2 which this document described. In 2010, when MeshCentral v1 was first designed, the Internet was very different. HTML5 and WebSocket did not exists, no such thing as a software container, etc. With MeshCentral version 2, a complete redesign was made to make the software much more in line with modern Internet deployment models. </p> <p>The advent of NodeJS, WebSocket, WebRTC and other web technologies coming out in the last 10 years has really made the design of MeshCentral v2 not only possible, but quite amazing. Being able to use a single programming language across platforms to JavaScript. Being able to easily exchange objects using web socket and JSON, being able to scale with WebRTC, deploy quickly with containers, etc. Looking back at the incredible advances in web technologies lead to an almost mandatory MeshCentral redesign. </p>","path":["Design and Architecture"],"tags":[]},{"location":"design/#goals-requirements","level":2,"title":"🎯 Goals &amp; Requirements","text":"<p>The goal of MeshCentral is to be the best open source remote management software in the world. Remote computer management is a big area with many different usages and requirements.

Since this software is sponsored by Intel, it’s going to support Intel® AMT really well, making it possible to manage a remote computer regardless of its OS or power state. Intel® AMT is not required to use this software, however it’s a great fit. </p>","path":["Design and Architecture"],"tags":[]},{"location":"design/#design-overview","level":2,"title":"🖥️  Design Overview","text":"<p>In this section, we do a very high level overview of MeshCentral’s design. MeshCentral has 3 big components :</p> <ul> <li>The server,</li> <li>The agent and </li> <li>The web application. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>There is of course more software that support these 3 components like the Windows Server Installer, ClickOnce application, MeshCentral Discovery Tool and more. These will be covered later. Most of the document will focus on these 3 main components. Another component that is significant but not part of the software itself is Intel® AMT (Intel® Active Management Technology). MeshCentral supports Intel AMT that acts like an optional hardware based agent for MeshCentral. </p> <p>When it comes to programming languages used, MeshCentral is mostly built with JavaScript with the agent having significant portable C code. This makes things pretty simple since the browser, server and agents can share some of the code. More importantly, JavaScript is great at parsing JSON and so, the main protocol used between the components is JSON over Web Socket. </p> <p></p> <p>It’s important to note that while JavaScript is used in all 3 components, the JavaScript runtime is very different. The JavaScript written to run within a browser sandbox uses different calls than the one running in NodeJS on the server or on the agent with DukTape. </p> <p>This is probably a good time to introduce DukTape (https://www.duktape.org/). Unlike the browser and NodeJS JavaScript engines, DukTape is a less known JavaScript runtime written in C. The agent is built in C code with little smarts other than being able to securely connect back to the server. The server then pushes to the agent a JavaScript file that the agent runs. This makes the agent very flexible since a developers can quickly change the JavaScript that is pushed to the agent and change the agent’s behavior instantly. </p> <p>Another interesting design decision is that MeshCentral makes almost no use of RESTful API’s. Instead, almost everything is done using WebSocket. This allows JSON objects to be exchanged fully asynchronously. There is no pushing the refresh button or polling as events are sent by all actors in real time. </p>","path":["Design and Architecture"],"tags":[]},{"location":"design/#meshcentral-server","level":2,"title":"🗄️ MeshCentral server","text":"<p>The MeshCentral server is a NodeJS application that is published on NPM at : https://www.npmjs.com/package/meshcentral Many administrators can get started quickly using <code>npm install meshcentral</code> once NodeJS is installed.

Browsers have a set of known trusted root certificates. The server’s web certificate is checked for validity including the name, time trusted CA and more. The agent does not have this. Instead, it just has a hash to a private server certificate. </p> <p>The public facing web certificate of the server can change frequently. For example, Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid 90 days. Agents need to be able to validate a specific server for a long time and don’t really need to trust anything else except one specific server. We also don’t want to tie the agents to a specific domain name as we could change that in the future or want to support servers with dynamic IP addresses and no fixed DNS names. </p> <p>To handle all this, the agent performs a TLS connection to the server and will first see the web certificate of the server. It will then exchange a set of web socket binary messages to the server to perform a secondary authentication with the server. </p> <p></p> <p>The secondary check allows the agent to confirm that this server does own the private key of the private certificate expected by the agent. The agent caches the hash of the “outer” web certificate. When re-connecting, if the agent sees the same outer web certificate, it will skip the secondary check. For obvious security raisons, it’s important that the agent not accept any management messages until the secondary check is completed or skipped. </p> <p>To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the secondary check also “pins” the outer web certificate. That is, the server both confirms it’s the right server and indicates to the agent the hash of the outer certificate that it must have seen during the TLS connection. The agent must check this hash to make sure there is no attacker in the middle. </p> <p>The agent connection design allows for reverse-proxies and TLS offload hardware. The agent will first connect a TLS session to the offload hardware. Clear traffic flows between the offload hardware and the server which will perform the secondary check if needed. </p> <p></p> <p>To makes all this work, the MeshCentral server must be able to fetch the hash of the outer web certificate from the reverse proxy. In this case, the server does not need the private key to the web certificate. Note that when the outer web certificate is updated, the server may have to perform many secondary checks at the same time causing a server slowdown during this time. To help with this, MeshCentral will offload the RSA signing operation to many slave processes (as many as the CPU core count on the server) to speed this up. In addition, native NodeJS RSA signing is used (not ForgeJS). </p> <p>The details of the secondary certificate check look like the diagram below. To boost speed, the exchange is fully asynchronous and both sides send the first message as soon as the TLS connection completes. </p> <p></p> <p>Note that these messages are binary (not JSON). The agent must be able to connect to the server independently of the JavaScript that is running in DukTape. So this exchange is handled by native C code in the agent. Binary message 1 is sent immediately after the TLS connection is setup. Both sides will send binary message 2 when message 1 is received and message 3 when message 2 is received. </p> <p>In addition, there are two extra messages of interest that can be sent by the agent right at the start. The agent may send the server message number 4 if the secondary check can be skipped and may send binary message number 5 indicating what server hash it expects to verify. Message number 5 is interesting because a server may have many “identities” at the same time, and so, the server will use message number 5 in order to use the right Agent Server certificate. </p> <p>In order to be as secure as possible, all hashes use SHA384 and certificates are RSA3072 and nonces are generated on both sides using a cryptographic random source.</p> <p>The server and agent signatures are computed like this : </p> <p></p> <p>While the server will often skip its RSA signature operation due to the agents caching the outer web certificate, the server must perform an RSA verify to each agent connection. This can’t be skipped but is needed to authenticate the agent. </p> <p>Once connected, the trust relationship between the server and the agent is one-way. That is, the server has management rights on the agent, but the agent does not have any right on the server. This is important since the agent does not, by default, have any credentials to the server. Any agent can connect to the server and claim to be part of a device group. </p>","path":["Design and Architecture"],"tags":[]},{"location":"design/#browser-to-agent-relay-and-webrtc","level":2,"title":"🌍 Browser to agent relay and WebRTC","text":"<p>Browsers and agents often need to communicate to each other. Data sessions are used for desktop, terminal, file transfers, etc. and must be setup securely. </p> <p>To setup a session between a browser and the agent, the server will send a URL to both sides to connect to. The URL is generated by the server and includes a unique connection token. It is sent to both the browser and agent using the web socket control channel and a JSON message. Both sides perform a websocket connection to the target URL and the server will “pipe” both sessions together to act as a passive relay. For security, the agent will only accept connections to the URL given by the server if the server has the same outer web certificate as its control connection. Also note that in this mode, the session is not end-to-end encrypted. The server is performing a TLS decrypt and re-encrypt and the traffic cost is high as each byte of data has to be received and sent again. </p> <p></p> <p>The relay server is just websocket server that will wait for connections with session tokens. When two connection with the same connection token arrive, the server makes sure that at least one of the two connections is an authenticated user, it then sends the character <code>c</code> on both sides to inform both parties that the relay is starting and then pipes both sessions together. Once the session is started, the browser and agent are free to send messages to each other. Note that when the server sends the relay URL to the agent, it also sends to the agent the user’s permissions flags. This may be used by the agent to limit what the user can do on this session. </p> <p>With this design, the flow control between the browser and agent is simple, each session gets its own end-to-end connection and the server will apply appropriate TCP back pressure on both sides as needed. </p> <p>A unique feature of MeshCentral is its use of WebRTC. WebRTC was introduced in major browsers as a way to allow browsers to directly communicate to each other and perform audio/video streaming. The mesh agent has a WebRTC data-only stack that is custom built for this project in C code. It’s compatible with Chrome and Firefox implementations and once a session is set up, allows data to flow directly from the browser to the agent, bypassing the server. </p> <p></p> <p>The use of WebRTC allows MeshCentral to scale better, to offer a faster user experience and lower hosting costs all at the same time. However, WebRTC is not easy, especially when you must maintain the C code for it and have to keep up with browser implementations, but the benefits are clear. </p> <p>To setup WebRTC, browsers typically use STUN and TURN servers to get traffic through any network obstacles (routers, proxies, firewalls). This infrastructure can be complex to setup especially if an administrator is not familiar with WebRTC concepts. To make things easy, MeshCentral opted to always start by using a websocket relay through the server to get things started. While a session is active, the browser and agent will attempt to automatically switch the session traffic to WebRTC when possible. This way, the session always works and gets more efficient when network conditions allow. </p> <p>To perform the switch-over, both browser and agent will exchange WebRTC control messages over the newly established web socket relay session. </p> <p></p> <p>In order to differentiate session traffic from WebRTC control traffic, the browser and agent agree to send WebRTC setup traffic using web socket text fragments. All other session traffic is sent using binary fragments. The agent has a special API allowing a session to be piped for a single fragment type. So we can perform a remote desktop session to the agent while trying to setup WebRTC at the same time. </p> <p>The browser will kick off the WebRTC setup sending the initial WebRTC offer with the agent responding with a WebRTC answer. If the WebRTC session gets setup, both sides need to negotiate a clear transition from the web socket session to the WebRTC session. To do this, both sides send a start switch control fragment (this is a text fragment), the other side will respond with an ACK when the web socket session is flushed out and it’s safe to switch. </p> <p>On the agent side, the new WebRTC session inherits the user access rights of the web socket. Currently, the web socket channel is still maintained open. While it’s not strickly needed, the web socket session terminates more cleanly than WebRTC and so, oddly its closure is used to signal the end of the WebRTC session. </p>","path":["Design and Architecture"],"tags":[]},{"location":"design/#messenger","level":2,"title":"💬 Messenger","text":"<p>MeshCentral includes its own messaging web application it can be used to chat, transfer files and optionally used for audio and video chat. It’s used to support two different usages :</p> <ul> <li> <p>User-to-user and</p> </li> <li> <p>user-to-computer communication. </p> </li> </ul> <p>In the first usage, two users that are connected to the same MeshCentral server at the same time can chat. If you are a MeshCentral administrator, you can see the list of currently logged in users and hit the chat button to launch a chat invitation. If accepted, the Messenger is open on both sides and the session starts. Alternatively, while managing a remote computer, an administrator can hit the chat button to cause the remote computer to open a web browser to the chat application. </p> <p></p> <p>The chat app is standalone web application that is served by the MeshCentral server using a connection token and title in the URL. Once loaded in its own web frame, the messenger web application will get the connection token and title from the URL and proceed to connect to the URL using web socket. The same web socket relay that is used for browser-to-agent connections is also used in this case for browser-to-browser connections. The server relay acts the same and pipes both sessions together after sending the character <code>c</code> to both sides. At this point, the messenger application will show the remote user as connected and chat and file transfers can start. File transfers are just a set of binary messages sent over the web socket session with lots of JSON control messages. </p> <p>Once the web socket session is setup, the messenger application will then attempt to perform a switch over to WebRTC. Both web application start by selecting a random number (not cryptographic) and the highest number will initiate the WebRTC offer. The other party will answer and both sides will trade interface candidates as they are discovered. If successful, the web socket session are flushed and the traffic is switched over to WebRTC. Because the switchover is done cleanly, it can occur while in the middle of a file transfer without the file being corrupted. </p> <p></p> <p>Finally, the web application will determine if the local computer is attached to a microphone and if it has a camera. If so, these options are offered in the chat window and audio/video chat is available for use. The chat app allows for one way setup of audio &amp; video sessions. This is typically what is needed in support scenarios where the audio/video session is one-way. </p> <p>The messenger web application will setup a separate WebRTC connection for audio/video in each direction but the code is present to augment the WebRTC control channel with audio/video which is a bit more efficient but more testing is needed before defaulting to this mode. </p>","path":["Design and Architecture"],"tags":[]},{"location":"design/#additional-resources","level":2,"title":"💡 Additional Resources","text":"<p>In addition to this document, there are a growing set of MeshCentral resources at :</p> <ul> <li> <p>https://www.meshcommander.com/meshcentral2. :</p> <p>This includes an Installer’s documents, a User’s Guide and plenty of YouTube tutorial videos.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For developers, it’s best to start on the MeshCentral GitHub repository at :</p> <ul> <li> https://github.com/Ylianst/MeshCentral</li> </ul> <p>If any issues are found, it’s best to create a new issue in GitHub or mail ylianst@gmail.com</p>","path":["Design and Architecture"],"tags":[]},{"location":"design/#conclusion","level":2,"title":"🏁 Conclusion","text":"<p>MeshCentral is a free, open source and powerful remote management solution that is cross- platform.

In other words, MeshCentral has a MPS server on port 4433 ready to receive Intel AMT CIRA connections.</p> <p></p> <p>When MeshCentral is first setup, a self-signed root certificate is created along with a MPS certificate that will be presented when a device connects on port 4433.

The browser will display a warning because the port 4433 certificate is not trusted, but this is expected.</p> <p></p> <p>The CIRA protocol is binary, but MeshCentral will detect that the request is made from a browser and return a short message:</p> <pre><code>MeshCentral2 MPS server.\nIntel® AMT computers should connect here.\n</code></pre> <p>This is practical to make sure connectivity with the MeshCentral MPS server is working. Now that we know the basics of Intel AMT CIRA and the MPS server, we can configure Intel AMT to connect.</p>","path":["Submodules and Features","Intel AMT"],"tags":[]},{"location":"intelamt/#activation-certificate-setup","level":2,"title":"Activation Certificate Setup","text":"<p>If you have an Intel AMT activation certificate, you should configure MeshCentral to take advantage of it. Your activation certificate must have been issued by one of the certificate authorities (CA’s) that is trusted by Intel AMT and MeshCentral will need the entire certificate chain to be provided since the entire chain is needed to perform Intel AMT ACM activation.</p> <p></p> <p>The leaf certificate will have the Intel AMT activation option and a specific domain name while the hash of the trusted CA certificate must be trusted by Intel AMT. The certificate chain will have to be setup in the domain section of the MeshCentral config.json file.</p> <p>If you have a certificate chain in a .pfx or .p12 format, place that file in the “meshcentral-data” folder and add the “AmtAcmActivation” section in the domain section like so:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"Cert\": \"devbox.mesh.meshcentral.com\",\n  },\n  \"domains\": {\n    \"\": {\n      \"title\": \"My Server\",\n      \"AmtAcmActivation\": {\n        \"log\": \"amtactivation.log\",\n        \"certs\": {\n          \"myamtcert\": {\n            \"certpfx\": \"amtcert.pfx\",\n            \"certpfxpass\": \"pfxpassword\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If you have the certificate chain in PEM format as a set of .crt files and a .key file, start by placing all of the certificate files in the “meshcentral-data” folder and setup the certificate chain like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"Cert\": \"devbox.mesh.meshcentral.com\",\n  },\n  \"domains\": {\n    \"\": {\n      \"title\": \"My Server\",\n      \"AmtAcmActivation\": {\n        \"log\": \"amtactivation.log\",\n        \"certs\": {\n          \"myvprocert\": {\n            \"certfiles\": [ \"amtacm-vprodemo.crt\",\n   \"amtacm-intermediate1.crt\",\n   \"amtacm-intermediate2.crt\",\n   \"amtacm-root.crt\" ],\n            \"keyfile\": \"amtacm-vprodemo.key\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>It’s important that the leaf certificate file be the first file in the “certfiles” array. The order of the other certificates is not important as MeshCentral will figure out and re-order them correctly. </p> <p>Within the new “AmtAcmActivation” section, there is a “log” entry. This is a log file that will contain every activation attempt including the details of the computer being activation and what Intel AMT administrator password was used for activation. This log file should be kept securely as it will contain Intel AMT credentials. It’s also important to have this file as a backup so that Intel AMT credentials are not lost after activation. If MeshCentral can’t write to this log, the activation will not go forward and will fail.</p> <p>Once the config.json was modified, restart the server. There will be two indications that the server has the new certificate correctly configured. For “Intel AMT only” groups, a new “Activation” link will show up. Clicking this link will show a command that can be run to perform ACM activation.</p> <p></p> <p>For device groups that operate with a Mesh Agent, you can edit the group and select the “Simple Admin Control Mode” Intel AMT activation policy. This policy is not available unless a correct Intel AMT ACM activation certificate is configured.</p> <p></p> <p>Once setup, Intel AMT will not automatically activate to Intel AMT unless the right situation is met. The Intel AMT activation certificate is for a specific domain name suffix, for example “meshcentral.com”. Intel AMT must be in a situation where this domain can be accepted. One of the following must be true:</p> <ul> <li>Intel AMT must have a wired Ethernet interface that is connected to a local network with a DHCP server responding with option 15 set to “xxx.meshcentral.com”.</li> <li>The name “meshcentral.com” by have been set as “Trusted FQDN” in MEBx.</li> <li>The name “meshcentral.com” must have been set using a USB key with a setup.bin file.</li> </ul> <p>Once Intel AMT is in a situation where ACM activation can occur, the activation command line can be run or the Mesh Agent will detect this situation and ask the server to perform activation.</p> <p></p> <p>The best way to test this feature is to create an “Intel AMT only” device group and run the MeshCMD command on the remote system to perform activation. If there is a problem, this process should clearly display why ACM activation fails.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Activation over wifi has some additional issues.   First you need to add your WiFi access point to that wifi configuration to allow CSME to take over WiFi when OS is not functioning. Then it should work.   Please also make sure you install Intel WiFi driver and Intel LMS package. It should work. You can detach the ethernet and then try connecting to that device using the IP address acquired by WiFi interface.   See Open AMT Cloud Toolkit project - a close relative to this project.

In tha folowing table is a list of settings that are available for the user : </p> Setting Description Cert Sets the DNS name of the server. If this name is not set, the server will run in \"LAN mode\". When set, the server\"s web certificate will use this name and the server will instruct agents and browsers to connect to that DNS name. You must set a server DNS name to run in \"WAN mode\". MeshCentral will not configure your DNS server. The DNS name must be configured separately. Port This sets the main web port used by the MeshCentral server and it\"s the same port that users and mesh agents will connect to. The default port is 443, but if the port is busy, the next available higher port is used (.e.g. 444) AliasPort Sets the main port that will be used by the server externally. By default is the same as \"Port\" above, but can be set to be different when next. See \"Server port aliasing\" section for more details. RedirPort This is the port for redirecting traffic in the web server. When the server is configured with HTTPS, users that uses HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS. Port 80 is the default port. So, redirection will happen from port 80 to port 443. MpsPort Port for Intel\" AMT Management Presence Server to receive Intel\" AMT CIRA (Client Initiated Remote Access) connections. The default is port 4433. This port is disabled in LAN mode. If user don\"t plan on using Intel\" AMT for management, this port can be left as-is. TLSOffload By default this option is set to \"false\". If set to \"true\", server will run both web port and the Intel AMT MPS port without TLS with the assumption that a TLS offloading is taking care of this task. For further details, see the \"TLS Offloading\" section. This option can also be set to the IP address of the reverse-proxy in order to indicate to MeshCental to only trust HTTP X-Forwarded headers coming from this IP address. See the \"Reverse-Proxy Setup\" section for an example. SelfUpdate When set to \"true\" the server will check for a new version and attempt to self-update automatically a bit after midnight local time every day. If set to a specific version such as \"1.1.21\" the server will immediately update to the specified version on startup if it's not already at this version. SessionKey This is the encryption key used to secure the user\"s login session. It will encrypt the browser cookie. By default, this value is randomly generated each time the server starts. If many servers are used with a load balancer, all servers should use the same session key. In addition, one can set this key so that when the server restarts, users do not need to re-login to the server. Minify Default value is 0, when set to 1 the server will serve \"minified\" web pages, that is, web pages that have all comments, white spaces and other unused characters removed. This reduces the data size of the web pages by about half and reduced the number requests made by the browser. The source code of the web page will not be easily readable, adding \"&amp;nominify=1\" at the end of the URL will override this option. User Specify a username that browsers will be automatically logged in as. Useful to skip the login page and password prompts. Used heavily during development of MeshCentral. NoUsers By default this option is \"false\" and if set to \"true\", server will only accept users from localhost (127.0.0.1) and will not have a login page. Instead, a single user is always logged in. This mode is useful if user opts to setup MeshCentral as a local tool instead of as a multi-user server MpsCert Specifies the official name of the Intel AMT MPS server. If not specified, this is the same as the official server name specified by \"cert\". This option is generally used with MPS aliasing, see the \"Server port aliasing\" section for more information. MpsAliasPort Specify an alias port for the MPS server. See the section on \"Server port aliasing\" for use of this option. ExactPorts If this option is set to \"true\", only the exact port will be used. By default, if a port is in use, the server will try to bind the next available higher port. This is true for the \"port\", \"redirport\" and \"mpsport\" settings. Lanonly Server\"s default mode if not set with \"--cert\" option. If this option is set to \"true\", Intel\" AMT MPS will be disabled, server name and fixed IP option will be hidden. Mesh agents will search for the server using multicast on the network. Wanonly A recommended option when running MeshCentral in the cloud. If set to \"true\", server will run as a cloud service and assumes LAN features are disabled. For this option to work, the server must have a fixed IP or DNS record using the \"--cert\"\" option. In this mode, LAN discovery features are disabled. AllowFraming By default is set to \"false\". If set to \"true\", web pages will be served in a way that allows them to be placed within an iframe of another web page. This is useful when you wish to add MeshCentral features into another website. AllowLoginToken By default is set to \"false\". If set to \"true\", the server allows login tokens to be used in the URL as a replacement for user login. This is useful along with \"allowFraming\" option to embed MeshCentral features into another website. MongoDB Used to specify the MongoDB connection string. If not specified, MeshCentral will use the NeDB database with the file meshcentral.db in the meshcentral-data folder. To setup MongoDB, please refer to the Database section of this document. MongoDBCol Used to specify the MongoDB collection name in the database. By default this value is \"meshcentral\". See Database section for more details on MongoDB setup. DbEncryptKey Specifies a password used to encrypt the database when NeDB is in use. If wanting to encrypt an existing database, use the \"dbexport\" and \"dbimport\" to save and reload the database with the encryption password set. WebRTC Set to \"true\" or \"false\" depending if you want to allow the server to setup WebRTC communication. If WebRTC is setup, management traffic will flow directly between the browser and mesh agent, bypassing the server completely. The default is false now, but will be switched to true when WebRTC is ready for production. ClickOnce Set to \"true\" or \"false\" to allow or disallow browser ClickOnce features. When enabled, browsers running on Windows will be shown extra options to allow RDP and other sessions through the MeshCentral server. This requires ClickOnce browser support that is built-in to IE and available as add-in to Chrome and Firefox.

In this mode, no login screen is displayed and browser will authenticate using the user’s domain credentials. Dns The DNS record for this domain. If specified, the domain is accessed using a DNS record like “customer1.servername.com” instead of “servername/customer1”. This feature requires the DNS server to be configured to point this server with a valid DNS record. CertUrl Load the TLS certificate for this domain from this https url. For example “https://127.0.0.1:123”. This option is useful when used along with the “TlsOffload” option. When MeshCentral is not doing any TLS but has a reverse-proxy or TLS offload device doing this work in front of the server, you can use this to have MeshCentral load the certificate from the server in front of MeshCentral.This is needed because when agents connect, they need to be told that the certificate they saw upon connecting is the correct one. Using this, MeshCentral will know what certificate the agents are expected to see. PasswordRequirements Used to specify the minimum password requirements for user authentication to this domain. By default, no password requirements are enforced but the user will see a password strength indicator that is not backed by any verifiable data.The value must be set to an object, for example:<code>{ \"\"min\"\": 8, \"\"max\"\": 128, \"\"upper\"\": 1, \"\"lower\"\": 1, \"\"numeric\"\": 1, \"\"nonalpha\"\": 1 }</code>This indicated that passwords must be at least 8 characters long and have at least one upper case, one lower case, one numeric and one non-alphanumeric character. You can also set the maximum length of the password, however MeshCentral has already a limit of 256 characters. Specifying anything above this will have no effect.Note that password requirements for Intel® AMT are defined by Intel and so, Intel® AMT passwords will always be verified using a separate set of requirements. <p>Note</p> <p>When the DNS value is set for a domain, a user can't access the domain using <code>servername/customer1</code>, and instead, it must be accessed with a valid DNS record, and the DNS server should be setup to have two or more DNS records pointing to the same IP address.</p> <p>In this mode, the server will serve a different TLS certificate depending on what DNS record is used to access the server.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown in the example above, we have two names that point to the same IP address. Since the configuration specifies the “dns” value, the second domain is only shown when the right name is used. We use “meshcentral” and “devbox” for DNS names, but in practice the user will use fully qualified domain names (FQDN) like “meshcentral.com” or “devbox.meshcentral.com”.</p>","path":["MeshCentral","MeshCentral Guide"],"tags":[]},{"location":"meshcentral/#server-peering","level":2,"title":"🤝 Server Peering","text":"<p>MeshCentral supports server peering.

You can solve this but obtaining a free trusted certificate from Let's Encrypt. There are some limitations and so, it’s best to get familiar with this service before starting. You will also need a valid domain name that you own and that points to your MeshCentral server.</p> <p></p> <p>Before moving forward with this section, make sure your MeshCentral server is working correctly, has a domain name pointing to it and that the HTTP redirection server on port 80 is enabled and working. MeshCentral’s HTTP port 80 server will be used in the process to prove to Let’s Encrypt that we have control over the domain. At any point, you may try to use letsdebug.net to see if your domain is setup correctly and/or debug any issues. When ready, add the “letsencrypt” section to the config.json file like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"RedirPort\": 80,\n  },\n  \"letsencrypt\": {\n    \"email\": \"myemail@myserver.com\",\n    \"names\": \"domain1.com,domain2.com\",\n    \"rsaKeySize\": 3072,\n    \"production\": false\n  },\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The only mandatory field is the email address, please enter a valid one.</p> <p>The names section is a list of domain names the requested certificate will be valid for. This must be a list of DNS names that are already pointing to your server. It’s important to understand you are not requesting these DNS names, rather, Let’s Encrypt will makes requests to prove control over all of these domain name before issuing the certificate. All the domain names you enter must point to the server and HTTP port 80 must be reachable over the internet. If you don’t specify names, the default MeshCentral certificate name is used, that is the configured <code>--cert [name]</code>.</p> <p>The RSA key size can only be 2048 or 3072, with the default being 3072. This is the number of bit used for the RSA key in the certificate. Bigger is more secure, but takes more time to compute.</p> <p>Lastly the production key, by default this is false. When set to false, MeshCentral will query the Let’s Encrypt staging server for a certificate. It’s highly recommended to try this first and make sure everything works before getting a real certificate. Keep production to false, run through the process at least once and make sure everything works. You will get a new certificate installed on the HTTPS server signed by a staging Let’s Encrypt certificate authority.</p> <p>The Let’s Encrypt certificates and files will be created in the “meshcentral-data” folder. Make sure to keep regular backups of the “meshcentral-data” folder and all sub-folders.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you placed the “letsencrypt” section in config.json, restart the server. The request to the Let’s Encrypt server may take a few minutes to a few hours. It’s best to have your DNS server name pointing to your server for over a day before doing this. Once the new certificate is received, the server will automatically restart and browsing to HTTPS on your server will show the new certificate. Here is what it looks like on FireFox:</p> <p></p> <p>If you successfully setup a Let’s Encrypt certificate using the Let’s Encrypt staging server (“production”: false) and everything looks good, stop the server, remove the “letsencrypt” folder in “meshcentral-data”, change production to “true” and start the server again.

The server name is set to <code>myservername.domain.com</code>, so that is the name that MeshCentral will give to agents to connect to. Also, the alias port is set to 443. So agents will be told to connect to “myservername.domain.com:443”.</p> <p>The “AgentPong” line instructs the server to send data to the agent each 300 seconds and the agent by default will send data to the server every 120 seconds. As long as NGINX timeouts are longer than this, connections should remain open.</p> <p>When agents connect, they will see the NGINX TLS certificate on port 443. MeshCentral needs to know about the NGINX certificate so that it can tell the agents this is the correct certificate they should expect to see. So, “certUrl” is used to tell MeshCentral where to get the certificates that agents will see when connecting.</p> <p>When NGINX forwards connections to MeshCentral, extra X-Forwarded headers will be added to each request. MeshCentral needs to know if these headers can be trusted or not. By setting “TlsOffload” to “127.0.0.1”, MeshCentral is told to trust these headers when requests come from “127.0.0.1”.</p> <p>In this example, make sure to change “127.0.0.1” to the IP address of NGINX and “Cert” to the external DNS name of the NGINX server.</p> <p>Next, we need to configure and launch NGINX.

Traefik will perform this redirection so MeshCentral will never see port 80 connections. Port 443 will be setup using the given TLS certificates. In this example, we just used the certificate files generated by MeshCentral in the “meshcentral-data” folder. You can use the two certificate files as-is.</p> <p>The backends section configures one MeshCentral server on port “4430”. Traefik will additionally check the health of the MeshCentral server periodically, every 30 seconds.</p> <p>The frontends section is what routes the connections coming in the entry points to the backend servers. In this case, the HTTPS entry point is routed to the MeshCentral server is the hostname matches <code>myserver.domain.com</code> or <code>localhost</code>.</p> <p>Finally, the API section creates a web portal on port 8080 for monitoring of Traefik.</p>","path":["MeshCentral","MeshCentral Guide"],"tags":[]},{"location":"meshcentral/#haproxy-reverse-proxy-setup","level":2,"title":"⚡ HAProxy Reverse-Proxy Setup","text":"<p>In this section, we will setup MeshCentral with HAProxy, a small popular reverse proxy software.

You are now ready to configure MeshCentral.</p> <p>Edit the <code>config.json</code> and make it look like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"Cert\": \"myserver.mydomain.com\",\n    \"Port\": 443,\n    \"RedirPort\": 80\n  },\n  \"domains\": {\n    \"\": {\n      \"Title\": \"MyServer\",\n      \"Title2\": \"Servername\",\n      \"NewAccounts\": false,\n      \"authStrategies\": {\n        \"jumpcloud\": {\n          \"__callbackurl\": \"https://server/auth-jumpcloud-callback\",\n          \"NewAccounts\": true,\n          \"entityid\": \"meshcentral\",\n          \"idpurl\": \"https://sso.jumpcloud.com/saml2/saml2\",\n          \"cert\": \"jumpcloud-saml.pem\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Take note that the <code>entityid</code>, <code>idpurl</code> and <code>cert</code> are values taken from JumpCloud. The callback URL should be configured in JumpCloud as we have done in previous steps. You can see that in the example above, we have <code>NewAccounts</code> set to false in the default MeshCentral domain, but set to true in the JumpCloud section. This indicates that new accounts are not allowed in this domain except if it’s a new user that is authenticating through JumpCloud.</p> <p>You are now ready to restart the MeshCentral server. Extra modules will be needed to support SAML and so, depending on your server configuration, you may need to run MeshCentral manually once to allow the new modules to be installed from NPM. Once restarted, you should see the JumpCloud sign-in button on the login screen.</p> <p></p> <p>Users can sign-in using the regular username and password or using JumpCloud.</p>","path":["MeshCentral","MeshCentral Guide"],"tags":[]},{"location":"meshcentral/#generic-saml-setup","level":3,"title":"Generic SAML setup","text":"<p>In this section, we look at configuring SAML with a generic authentication provider.

We will refer to it as “MeshCentral1”. When MeshCentral1 was designed, HTML5 did not exist and web sockets where not implemented in any of the major browsers. Many design decisions were made at the time that are no longer optimal today. With the advent of the latest MeshCentral, MeshCentral1 is no longer supported and MeshCentral v2 has been significantly redesigned and mostly re-written based of previous version. Here is a list of improvements made in MeshCentral when compared with MeshCentral1 :</p> <ul> <li>Quick Installation – <p>By having MeshCentral published on NPM (www.npmjs.com) it’s now easy to download and install MeshCentral on both Linux and Windows. On Linux you can use  NPM directly (<code>npm install meshcentral</code>) and on Windows you can use the <code>.MSI installer</code>.</p> </li> <li>Cross-Platform Support – <p>Contrary to MeshCentral1 that only runs on Windows, MeshCentral can run on any environment that supports NodeJS. This includes Windows, Linux and OSX. Because MeshCentral runs on Linux, it often lowers hosting costs and makes it possible to run MeshCentral in a Docker container environment.</p> </li> <li>Runs with Little Compute Resources – <p>Typical MeshCentral1 installation requires a large disk space foot print (approx* 30G of disk space) and is compute intensive even for small deployments. MeshCentral requires little resources to host (70MB) and able to deliver reasonable performance on a 900Mhz CPU with 1GB RAM. </p> </li> <li>Multi-Tenancy  and Load Balancing Support – <p>MeshCentral can handle hosting many server instances at once. Each instance or <code>domain</code> has it’s own administrators, users and computers to manage. The server can handle each instance using a url path <code>server.com/customer1</code> or a DNS name <code>customer1.server.com</code>. Many customers can be handled by having all the DNS names point to the same server IP address. MeshCentral will take care of serving the right TLS certificate for each connection.</p> </li> <li>Single Executable – <p>MeshCentral is a single-module or single executable server. All of the components of MeshCentral1 including IIS, Swarm, AJAX, Social, Manageability Servers are all build into one single executable. This makes it super easy to setup and run, it also minimizes problems and overhead caused by having many components communicate to each other. When the server is updated, all of the components are updated at once and effective.</p> </li> <li>Web Application Design – <p>MeshCentral1 has 100’s of web pages and often times a click on a web page causes the browser to load a different web page and this creates more load on the server. With MeshCentral there are only two main web pages: The login page and the main web application. This design is much more responsive since the server now delegates most of the UI workload to the client’s web browser.</p> </li> <li>Real-Time User Interface – <p>In MeshCentral, the user never has to hit the <code>refresh</code> button to update the web page. The web interface is completely real-time and updates as things change. MeshCentral uses websockets to connect to the server and get real-time events.</p> </li> <li>Single Programming Language – <p>MeshCentral1 used JavaScript on the browser, C# on the server and C for the agent. Use of 3 different programming languages means that developers wanting to implement a new use-case needs to have sufficient skills to change between these 3 languages during the coding session. Makes the code significantly more difficult to understand and maintain.</p> </li> <li>Support for LAN only Mode – <p>MeshCentral is capable of being setup as “LAN only” mode. In fact, this is the default mode when no static name or IP address is provided. In this mode, MeshAgents perform a multicast search on the network for the server making a static DNS/IP unnecessary.</p> </li> <li>Support for TLS Offloaders – <p>TLS offloaders are now fully supported. This means that MeshCentral can handle way more network connections and traffic significantly.</p> </li> <li>Support for CIRA User/Pass Login – <p>MeshCentral now supports both Intel AMT CIRA user/pass login and certificate login. Compared to MeshCentral1 that only supported certificate login, user/pass login is easier to setup and it can also be used for TLS offloaders and CIRA authentication. </p> </li> <li>No Live State Stored in the Database – <p>One if the big problems with MeshCentral1 is that a lot of the live states (Agent, User and AMT connections and disconnections) needed to be stored in the database. This caused a few problems, first the extra load on the database that was un-necessary, but also that servers did not have real-time state information about other servers (they had to query the database). This resulted in more load on the database and scaling issues. In MeshCentral, all live states are kept in the RAM which boosts performance significantly.</p> </li> <li>Agentless Intel AMT Support – <p>With MeshCentral1, administrators have to install the MeshAgent software on all computers, even if it was only for used for Intel AMT. MeshCentral supports a new agent-less mesh type that allows administrators to just setup the server strictly for Intel AMT only.</p> </li> <li>Latest Security &amp; Crypto algorithms – <p>MeshCentral uses all the latest cryptographic algorithm, notably SHA384 and RSA3072 making it more resistant to future quantum computer attacks. This would be very difficult to retrofit into MeshCentralv1 since it would require change of database schema and 1000’s of line of code thus making the server incompatible with the current version version, making migration difficult.</p> </li> <li>Support for Email Verification and Password Recovery – <p>MeshCentral can be configured with an SMTP server to send out e-mail confirmation messages and password recovery message. This is an important feature that was missing in MeshCentral1.</p> </li> <li>MeshInterceptor Support – <p>MeshCentral can insert HTTP and Intel AMT redirection credential into a live data stream. This is useful to allow an administrator to securely pass Intel AMT password and control over an Intel AMT computer via web browser without the additional administrator login UI.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It’s possible to perform migration to MeshCentral from MeshCentral1 server using a migration package. The MeshCentral Migration Tool will convert your existing user database into a format that can be imported into MeshCentral.</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to the migration tool, MeshCentral has a special module that will update all MeshAgents from v1 to v2 so the transition should be simple.</p>","path":["MeshCentral","MeshCentral Guide"],"tags":[]},{"location":"meshcentral/#additional-resources","level":2,"title":"💡 Additional Resources","text":"<p>In addition to this document, there are a growing set of MeshCentral tutorial videos available on YouTube which covers all of the basic at www.meshcommander.com/meshcentral2/tutorials .

To do this the proper way, you should make a new folder called <code>meshcentral-web</code> in the main directory, where you find other folders like <code>meshcentral-data</code>, <code>meshcentral-backup</code>, <code>meshcentral-files</code>, and <code>node-modules</code>. Inside <code>meshcentral-web</code>, make another folder named <code>public</code> and copy the entire <code>node_modules/meshcentral/public/images</code> folder into this new <code>meshcentral-web/public</code> folder and then edit the files in <code>meshcentral-web/public/images/</code>.
