# MeshCentral Documentation

## About

MeshCentral is a full computer management web site. With MeshCentral, you can run your own web server to remotely manage and control computers on a local network or anywhere on the internet. Once you get the server started, create device group and download and install an agent on each computer you want to manage. A minute later, the new computer will show up on the web site and you can take control of it. MeshCentral includes full web-based remote desktop, terminal and file management capability.

To try out this software on the public server, please visit [MeshCentral.com/login](https://meshcentral.com/login). Be mindful that the public MeshCentral server comes with no guaranties, most should setup their own server.
